# Team Rules


## Psychological Safety

- Honesty : We would be honest about the work we have done / are doing
- Safe Space : The group meetings is a safe space for everyone where everyone's ideas are welcomed and heard equally without any hesitation.
- Share Ideas without hesitation

## Commitment

- As most of the deadlines are on Sunday, we would aim for a Friday deadline with a hard deadline for Saturday afternoon.
- We would break our tasks into smaller tasks
- We would use AGILE development technique
- We would spend a minimum time on the project
- We would adhere to the deadline and reach out if we are stuck somewhere

## Conflict

- We would try to understand the other person's point and situation in cases where we feel the person is not working.
- If this still continues, we would have a neutral party (Leaders, Allison) in the meeting to discuss the issue
- We would try to support one another as much as possible

## We would be using github issues for Issue tracking

## Task List

- We would have a meeting on Monday for setting up the expectations/ tasks for the week.
